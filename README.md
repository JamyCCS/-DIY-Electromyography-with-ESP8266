# -DIY-Electromyography-with-ESP8266
This is a project on making a small compact  Electromyography device that will show Muscle contraction data real-time on an OLED display and also store data and send them to android apps through ESP8266 wifi  NodeMCU
Electronics Needed-
i)EMG sensor
ii) Two 9V battery 
iii) Oled Display
iv) ESP 8266 NodeMCU
v) Buck converter

Software used to design the PCB -
EasyEDA

Later on,  an Android app might be created using  Python and integrated with the NodeMCU to store and analyze the myography data.
